API hosted at https://currencyconverterapi-fjbjdzgndrh0h0e5.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net


This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.11.

## Running locally

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

You don't need to run the API locally as it's also hosted on Azure, but you can run ```dotnet run``` in case you want to.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:
```bash
ng test
```

## Future scope

- Adding a double arrow button to quickly swap the To and From currencies
- Exchange rates over time with visualised data
